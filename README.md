## Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from MeriSkill internship, encompassing detailed records of employee demographics, job roles, performance ratings, work-life balance, satisfaction levels, and attrition status.

## Tools
The dashboards were created using the following tools:
- **Power BI**: For creating the visualizations and interactive elements.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data preparation and cleaning.
- **SQL**: For querying and extracting data from the HR database.

## Data Preparation
Data preparation involved the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Extracting raw HR data from the database.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
3. **Data Transformation**: Aggregating data by demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and other relevant categories.
4. **Data Loading**: Importing the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI for visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to uncover initial insights and validate the data:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating summary statistics for key metrics such as attrition rates, satisfaction levels, and performance ratings.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying patterns in employee attrition over time.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring relationships between different factors, such as job roles and attrition rates.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examining the distribution of attrition across different demographics, job roles, and satisfaction levels.

## Findings from Data Analysis
1. **Demographics**:
   - Higher attrition rates are observed among male employees compared to female employees.
   - Employees in the Life Sciences and Medical fields show higher attrition rates.
   - Younger employees (18-30 years) have higher attrition rates compared to older age groups.

2. **Turnover Analysis I**:
   - Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives have the highest attrition rates.
   - The Research & Development department experiences the highest attrition.
   - Employees who travel frequently for business show higher attrition rates.

3. **Turnover Analysis II**:
   - Entry-level employees have the highest attrition rates.
   - Employees working overtime show higher attrition rates.
   - Higher attrition rates are observed among employees with lower performance ratings.

4. **Employee Wellness**:
   - Employees dissatisfied with their work environment and relationships have higher attrition rates.
   - Higher job satisfaction correlates with lower attrition rates.
   - Employees with moderate job involvement show higher attrition rates.

## Recommendations
Based on the data analysis, the following recommendations are made:
1. **Targeted Retention Programs**: Develop retention programs focused on high-risk groups such as younger employees, entry-level positions, and specific job roles with high attrition.
2. **Improve Work Environment**: Enhance the work environment and relationship satisfaction to reduce attrition rates.
3. **Support for Frequent Travelers**: Provide additional support and incentives for employees who travel frequently for business to reduce attrition.
4. **Performance Improvement Plans**: Implement performance improvement plans for employees with lower ratings to increase engagement and reduce attrition.
5. **Work-Life Balance Initiatives**: Promote a healthy work-life balance to improve job satisfaction and reduce attrition.

## Conclusion
The HR Attrition Dashboard provides valuable insights into the factors influencing employee turnover. By leveraging the interactive visualizations and analysis, HR teams can make data-driven decisions to improve retention strategies, enhance employee satisfaction, and optimize overall workforce management. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the dashboard will help in identifying new trends and areas for improvement.
